The instructions below should allow an experienced WRE admin to
get WRE up and running quickly. For more online instructions visit
http://wiki.webgui.org/


PRIOR TO INSTALLING

This WRE has only been tested with CentOS 6.  It should work on Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 6, but has not been tested.  This WRE has not been
tested on any other platform.


INSTALLING

1. Unpack the archive.

	mkdir /data
	cd /data
	tar xvfz /path/to/wre-x.x.x.tar.gz

2. Download a copy of WebGUI from http://update.webgui.org/, and install it.
    cd /data
    tar xvfz /path/to/webgui-x.y.z-stable.tar.gz

3. Add a "webgui" user to the system. Note that you can name this 
user whatever you want, but we recommend "webgui". On most systems 
you run a command similar to the following as the root user:

	adduser -s /sbin/nologin webgui
            - or -
	useradd -s /sbin/nologin webgui

    NOTE: If you're just using the WRE for development on your 
    machine, feel free to just use your own user account rather than 
    creating a new one.

4. Follow the instructions in BUILD.redhat to install packages and modules
   needed by WebGUI.

5. Create a MySQL user for backups.

grant select, lock tables, show databases on *.* to backup\@'localhost' identified by 'XXXXXXXXXX';

6. Create your DNS entries (or add to /etc/hosts) for the sites you will be
   using, including the AWStats site.

7. Customize the WRE configuration file with database users, paths and other items.

    vim /data/wre/etc/wre.conf

8. Run the WRE setup script to create base templates for nginx, logrotate and Spectre

    /data/wre/sbin/wresetup.pl
    
9. On the command-line, go to /data/WebGUI/sbin, and as root, run the testEnvironment.pl
    script to install any new dependencies in WebGUI that may be missing from the WRE.

10. Visit your new web site!

11. Add the following cron jobs to your server's cron tab.

	*/3 * * * * /data/wre/sbin/wremonitor.pl
	0 2 * * * /data/wre/sbin/backup.pl

	If you are using the demo system then add this:

	0 0 * * * /data/wre/sbin/democleanup.pl
