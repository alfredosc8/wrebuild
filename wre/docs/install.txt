The instructions below should allow an experienced WRE admin to
get WRE up and running quickly. For more online instructions visit
http://wiki.webgui.org/


PRIOR TO INSTALLING

The WRE works best on a Linux-based operating system. We recommend 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but it is not required. You can also use 
the WRE on Mac OS X, BSD, and Windows based platforms.


INSTALLING

1. Unpack the archive.

	mkdir /data
	cd /data
	tar xvfz /path/to/wre-x.x.x-osname.tar.gz


2. Add a "webgui" user to the system. Note that you can name this 
user whatever you want, but we recommend "webgui". On most systems 
you run a command similar to the following as the root user:

	adduser -s /sbin/nologin webgui
            - or -
	useradd -s /sbin/nologin webgui

    NOTE: If you're just using the WRE for development on your 
    machine, feel free to just use your own user account rather than 
    creating a new one.


3. If you have an existing Apache or MySQL running please shut them
down now. On most systems you can shut them down hard by running
commands like this:

	killall mysqld
	killall httpd

4. Install Percona mysql.  See instructions in BUILD.redhat and BUILD.mac

Leave in the test user and database, as they're needed for the WRE to see if
mysql is up and running.

5. If you have a MySQL config file at /etc/my.cnf please remove or
rename it so that it doesn't interfere with the WRE MySQL.

	cp /data/wre/var/setupfiles//my.cnf /etc/my.cnf.old


6. Create your DNS entries (or add to /etc/hosts) for the sites you
will be using, including the AWStats site.


7. Use the WRE environment

	cd /data/wre/sbin
    . setenvironment.sh

    NOTE: You could add the following command to your profile so it
    executes every time you log in.  However, on CentOS 5 servers
    this can interfere with yum running:

    . /data/wre/sbin/setenvironment.sh


8. Customize the WRE configuration file with database users, paths and other items.

    vim /data/wre/etc/wre.conf


9. Run the WRE setup script to create base templates for nginx, logrotate and Spectre

    /data/wre/sbin/wresetup.pl --configFile=/data/wre/etc/wre.conf
    

10. On the command-line, go to /data/WebGUI/sbin, and as root, run the testEnvironment.pl
script to install any new dependencies in WebGUI that may be missing from the WRE.


11. Visit your new web site!


12. Add the following cron jobs to your server's cron tab.

	0 0 * * * /data/wre/sbin/logrotate.pl
	*/3 * * * * /data/wre/sbin/wremonitor.pl
	0 2 * * * /data/wre/sbin/backup.pl

	If you are using the demo system then add this:

	0 0 * * * /data/wre/sbin/democleanup.pl




PLATFORM SPECIFIC NOTES
-----------------------

* Red Hat Linux

This note applies to all linux' that use chkconfig to setup services. These
include RHEL, Fedora, Mandrake, SuSE, CentOS, and others. You can set up the
WRE to start automatically at system boot by running the following commands
after the WRE is installed:

ln -s /data/wre/sbin/services/redhat/webgui /etc/init.d/webgui
chkconfig --add webgui
chkconfig webgui on

On RHEL 5 or higher you need to install the libgomp RPM.

Installing Percona via yum:

rpm -Uhv http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-release/percona-release-0.0-1.i386.rpm
yum install -y Percona-Server-{server,client,shared,devel}-55


* SELinux

The WRE contains no policies for configuring SELinux.  If you distribution
uses SELinux, you will need to disable it, set it into permissive mode,
or write your own policies for SELinux.


* Mac OS X

There is no command line user add script on Mac OSX. Therefore you can either
use the graphical "Accounts" manager in "System Preferences", or the really
horrible "netinfo" command line utility. Alternatively, you can also download
some free user utilities from this site:

http://www.osxgnu.org/software/pkgdetail.html?project_id=231#4095

To get the WRE to start automatically at boot run the following commands:

ln -s /data/wre/sbin/services/osx/org.webgui.wre.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
