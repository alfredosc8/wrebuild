-------------------------------------

This file contains a list of gotchas that you should be aware of that will
affect your upgrade from one version of the WRE to another. Before upgrading
the WRE you should always read this file in the new version you wish to
upgrade to.

WRE 1.0.0

This is another complete rewrite of the WRE, where all binaries and modules
have been removed, and should be provided by the hosting OS or by
installing from CPAN.  This WRE is a set of scripts to automatically create
configuration files for WebGUI, Apache/mod_perl and nginx.

There is no automated upgrade process to go from an earlier version of the WRE
to this one.

WRE 0.9.6

This is almost a complete rewrite of the WRE, even to the point of
replacing Apache with nginx and Starman.  There is no automated upgrade
process to go from an earlier version of the WRE to this one.


WRE 0.9.4
- Apache ServerAdmin directive

In the apache configs there is now a default ServerAdmin config
This requires an additional template variable in your templates
See var/setupfiles/modperl.template and var/setupfiles/modproxy.template

This will have to be fixed in the wre management scripts

- Spectre pid-file dir

Newer WebGUI versions use a pid-file for spectre. For this you have to use
a directory. We suggest /data/wre/var/run
This file is also used for the apache .pid files now.

WRE 0.9.1

A serious flaw was discovered with MySQL 5.1 after the release of WRE 0.9.0.
Unfortunately there's no way to recover from this until Sun Microsystems fixes
a serious number of flaws with MySQL 5.1. So the only course of action we had
was to downgrade to MySQL 5.0 in WRE 0.9.1. Unfortunately this is painful for
you IF YOU HAVE ALREADY UPGRADED TO WRE 0.9.0. If you have not upgraded to
WRE 0.9.0 then you can ignore the rest of this, and upgrade from 0.8.x to
0.9.1 with no trouble.

To install WRE 0.9.1 you'll have to create a fresh WRE with dumps of your
existing databases. The following are the steps you'll need to take.

1) Run the following command for each of your databases:

mysqldump -uroot -pYOURPASS www_example_com > www_example_com.sql

Replace YOURPASS with your password and www_example_com with the database
name.

2) Shut down all WRE services:

wreservice.pl --stop all

3) Move the existing WRE out of the way.

mv /data/wre /data/wre.090

4) Install WRE 0.9.1 following the instructions in install.txt.

5) Copy your existing site configurations to the new WRE:

cp /data/wre.090/etc/*.modproxy /data/wre/etc/
cp /data/wre.090/etc/*.modperl /data/wre/etc/
cp /data/wre.090/etc/awstats.* /data/wre/etc/

6) Recreate the databases and load the data for each site:

mysql -uroot -pYOURPASS -e "create database www_example_com"
mysql -uroot -pYOURPASS www_example_com < www_example_com.sql

Replace YOURPASS with your password and www_example_com with your database
name.

7) Grant privileges to each of your databases. You'll need the dbuser and
dbpass values from each of your WebGUI config files.

mysql -uroot -pYOURPASS -e "grant all privileges on www_example_com.* to DBUSER@localhost identified by 'DBPASS'"

Replace YOURPASS with your password and www_example_com with your database
name. Replace DBUSER and DBPASS with the dbuser and dbpass directives from the
WebGUI config file for this site.

8) Now we have to tell MySQL to use the new usernames and passwords:

mysql -uroot -pYOURPASS -e "flush privileges"

9) Now your sites should be up and running again. Start the remaining WRE
services.

wreservice.pl --start web spectre



WRE 0.8.5

When starting modperl these warnings will be written to the modperl errorlog:
ap_get_server_banner() not available until httpd/2.2.4 falling back to 
ap_get_server_version() at /data/wre/prereqs/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i686-linux/XSLoader.pm line 94.
they are annoying, but not harmfull and will be fixed in WRE 0.9.0

WRE 0.8.4

This version lacks two perl modules that Exception::Class depends on,
Class::Data::Inheritable and Devel::StackTrace

WRE 0.8.2

This version will only work with WebGUI 7.4.22 and 7.5.1 or higher. This is
because of a massive change to JSON, which is used heavily by both WRE and
WebGUI. Unfortunately there's no way around this. If you need a WRE for WebGUI
7.4.21 or below, please use WRE 0.8.1. 



WRE 0.8.1

We made a change to the MySQL config so that it will index search terms as
small as two characters. Previously they had to be at least four. If you'd
like to retroactively apply this change to your site, you must reindex your
WebGUI sites with the search.pl utility that comes with WebGUI.



WRE 0.8.0

This version of the WRE is a complete rewrite of the WRE from the ground up.
All templates, file locations, APIs, etc have been changed in this release.
Therefore there is no direct upgrade path from previous WRE versions to WRE
0.8.0. A migration document has been created in the WebGUI community wiki. You
should follow the advice in that document to migrate your configurations from
a previous version of the WRE to this new version. Here's the URL:
