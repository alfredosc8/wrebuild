NOTE: There is no upgrade procedure from versions prior to WRE 0.9.6 for WebGUI 8
as WRE 0.9.6 is a complete rewrite of the system. To upgrade you must remove the
old WRE and install a completely new one.

To upgrade the WRE follow these simple steps:

1. Download the new version.

2. Dump all site databases.

3. Make backups of everything in wre/etc.

4. Shutdown your existing WRE.

5. Delete the old WRE.

6. Install the new WRE in its place.

7. Build a site for each old server using addsite.pl.

8. Translate modproxy configuration files to nginx.

9. Read /data/wre/docs/install.txt and /data/wre/docs/changelog.txt to make sure there aren't any new instructions.

10. Start the WRE.
